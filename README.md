# AIS Project - Financial Transactions

## Project objective

Apply differential privacy techniques to ensure the privacy of individual data points during machine learning model training, while minimizing the impact on model performance. Start by training a machine learning model with differential privacy mechanisms, using PySyft or Opacus to implement noise addition to model updates or gradients. The ultimate goal is to achieve a balance between model accuracy and privacy projection. Use publically available datasets (e.g. patient records or financial transactions, ...). Research can be done by using PySyft or Opacus' differential privacy tools to introduce noise to gradients during model training, ensuring the model does not memorize specific data points.
